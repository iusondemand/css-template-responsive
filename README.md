# css-template-responsive
A simple responsive css template to build simple web pages, with a structure easy to customize for the ones who like to edit css manually and have full control of the source code.


You will find the positioning of the 3 div columns to be patched with large screens. Then I would add a menu solutions, possible with a menu css only with an hover feature to open menus without a click. Finally I sidebar, probabily connected with the menu, and an image/div slider, for example bxslider.

Anyone can help, thanks.
